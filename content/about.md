My teaching and research activities focus on remote sensing, soil sciences and biogeochemical cycles (mainly carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus).

  <p style="color: #5f464b; background-color: #ece4b7; font-family: Roboto; font-style: italic"> Organic farms are generally achieving a balance between nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium outputs and inputs, thus limiting the risk of soil depletion.</p>
