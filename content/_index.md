Welcome! My name is Benjamin Nowak and I am a French lecturer in agronomy. This website is for sharing my [research projects](https://bjnnowak.netlify.app/about/) and courses with engineering students. Most of the posts here describe applications of digital tools to agriculture, based on specific agronomic case studies.
