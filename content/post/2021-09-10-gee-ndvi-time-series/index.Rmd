In a previous [post](https://bjnnowak.netlify.app/2021/08/09/qgis-how-to-create-ndvi-maps-from-sentinel-2-multispectral-images/) we saw how to create an NDVI map from raw Sentinel-2 data. However, this procedure has limitations when you want to process many dates. This new tutorial will show you how to calculate NDVI time series from Sentinel-2 images using the [Google Earth Engine](https://code.earthengine.google.com/) (you need to have a Google account to use GEE). 

Thanks to JavaScript API, GEE allows to calculate NDVI for various sites of interest without having to download Sentinel-2 raw data. We will see here how annual NDVI evolution enable to detect winter cover crops, as realized in [this article](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac007c/meta). 

# 1. Define plot geometry

After logging into [Google Earth Engine](https://code.earthengine.google.com/), we will start by delimiting the contours of our plot of interest. Create a new **Script** (left panel) and write the following lines of JavaScript code in the **Editor** (center panel).

```
// Create your plot
// (you can also do it manually directly on the map)
var geometry = ee.Geometry.Polygon(
        [[[3.246980338791907, 45.835336025505995],
        [3.247881561020911, 45.83249544350292],
        [3.249383598069251, 45.83285426186172],
        [3.2479673917093876, 45.837279498073954],
        [3.2462507779398564, 45.837458892119855]]]);

```
As there is an uncertainty on the georeferencing of Sentinel images, I generally use a 20m buffer to make sure to keep only pixels within the plot.

```
// Apply negative buffer to geometry
var geometryBuff = geometry.buffer(-20)

```
We are now ready to plot these geometries on the map.

```
// Add plot and buffer to the map
// and specify fill color and layer name
Map.addLayer(geometry,{color:'green'},'Border');
Map.addLayer(geometryBuff,{color:'red'},'Buffer');

// Center map on the plot
Map.centerObject(geometry);

```

# 2. Create a collection of clean Sentinel-2 images

When loading Sentinel images, we will remove data biased by shadows or cloud cover. To do this we will use two levels of filtering: first ignore satellite images with cloud cover above a certain threshold and then, for the images that have been retained, keep only the pixels identified as soil or vegetation.

Let's start by loading a Sentinel image collection that corresponds to our area and period of interest.

```
// Load image collection of Sentinel-2 imagery
// (choose SR for atmospheric corrections to surface reflectance)
var S2 = ee.ImageCollection('COPERNICUS/S2_SR') 
  // Remove cloudy images from the collection
  .filterMetadata('CLOUDY_PIXEL_PERCENTAGE', 'less_than', 20)
  // Filter to study period
  .filterDate('2019-09-01', '2020-10-01')
  // Filter to plot boundaries
  .filterBounds(geometryBuff);

```
We will now create a filter to keep only the pixels previously identified as vegetation or bare soil. This information is available in the [Scene Classification Layer (SCL)](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/technical-guides/sentinel-2-msi/level-2a/algorithm) provided with Sentinel-2 data (Note that you can also do the opposite: remove pixels identified as snow, clouds or shadows).

```
// Function to keep only vegetation and soil pixels
function maskCloudAndShadows(image) {
  // Select SCL layer
  var scl = image.select('SCL'); 
  // Select vegetation and soil pixels
  var veg = scl.eq(4); // 4 = Vegetation
  var soil = scl.eq(5); // 5 = Bare soils
  // Mask if not veg or soil
  var mask = (veg.neq(1)).or(soil.neq(1));
  return image.updateMask(mask);
}

// Apply custom filter to S2 collection
var S2 = S2.map(maskCloudAndShadows);

````

# 3. Compute NDVI

We will now compute the NDVI based on the red (band 4) and infrared (band 8) reflectance.

```
// Function to compute NDVI and add result as new band
var addNDVI = function(image) {
return image.addBands(image.normalizedDifference(['B8', 'B4']));
};

// Add NDVI band to image collection
var S2 = S2.map(addNDVI);

```
One thing to note: GEE will calculate the NDVI for the finest resolution available for bands 4 and 8 (10m in this case).

# 4. Plot NDVI time series

We can now calculate **for each date** the **average NDVI** of the plot with the following function:

```
var evoNDVI = ui.Chart.image.seriesByRegion(
  S2,                // Image collection
  geometryBuff,      // Region
  ee.Reducer.mean(), // Type of reducer to apply
  'nd',              // Band
  10);               // Scale

```
We can finally plot the results: 

```
var plotNDVI = evoNDVI                 // Data
    .setChartType('LineChart')         // Type of plot
    .setOptions({                      // Plot customization
      interpolateNulls: true,
      lineWidth: 1,
      pointSize: 3,
      title: 'NDVI annual evolution',
      hAxis: {title: 'Date'},
      vAxis: {title: 'NDVI'}
});

```

To return to our original question, the winter increase in NDVI suggests that a cover crop was sown, then destroyed at the end of December. Next cash crop was sown in following spring.

# 5. Exploring within-field heterogeneities

We can also plot the different NDVI maps obtained. For the sake of simplicity, we will show here only one map: the median NDVI per pixel for the whole study period.

```
// Extract NDVI band from S2 collection 
var NDVI = S2.select(['nd']);
// Extract median NDVI value for each pixel
var NDVImed = NDVI.median(); 

// Hex values for red to green color palette
var pal = ['#d73027', '#f46d43', '#fdae61', '#fee08b', '#d9ef8b', '#a6d96a'];

// Display NDVI results on map
Map.addLayer(
  NDVImed.clip(geometryBuff),        // Clip map to plot borders
  {min:0.2, max:0.4, palette: pal},  // Specify color palette 
  'NDVI'                             // Layer name
  )

```
