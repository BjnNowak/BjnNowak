In this post, we will perform a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to explore the evolution of songs' features over the years. We will see how we can use the {tidyverse} tools and syntax to perform this PCA.

For this, we will use the TidyTuesday dataset of [Top 100 Billboard](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-09-14/readme.md). To this data set is associated a characterization of the songs according to several features (danceability, mode, tempo...), provided by the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#endpoint-get-audio-features).

# 1. Data preparation

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Load data 
# Billbord ranking
billboard <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-09-14/billboard.csv')
# Songs features based on Spotify API
features <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-09-14/audio_features.csv')

head(features)

```

For the next part of our analysis we will look at **the evolution of songs' features over the years**. To do this, we need to create a column with the year of songs' creation, using {tidyverse} tools. Then, we will add this new column to songs' features data. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)

bill_prep<-billboard%>%
  # Keep only 1st appearance on Billboard
  filter(
    (weeks_on_chart==1)&(instance==1)
  )%>%
  # Add Year column
  mutate(year=format(
    as.Date(week_id,"%m/%d/%Y"),format="%Y")
  )%>%
  # Set year as numeric
  mutate(year=as.numeric(year))

# Add year to songs' features data
features_prep<-features%>%
  left_join(bill_prep,by="song_id")

```

# 2. Data cleaning and PCA

First, we will select the variables on interest for the PCA, plus one additional variable (year of creation of the song).

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

PCA_data<-features_prep%>%
  select(
    # Variables of interest for PCA
    c(danceability,energy,instrumentalness,
      key,acousticness,mode,valence,tempo,
      time_signature,speechiness,loudness,liveness,
    # Add year as supplementary variable  
      year
    )
  )%>%
  # Remove rows with NA
  drop_na()

```

We are now ready to perform the PCA.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

PCA <-PCA_data%>%
  select(-year)%>%
  # Perform PCA with scaled variables
  prcomp(scale = TRUE)

```

Now, we need the {broom} extension to access the results of *prcomp()* with the {tidyverse} syntax. After loading {broom}, you can use the *tidy()* function to access the results of the PCA such as eigenvalues.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(broom)

PCA%>%
  tidy(matrix = "eigenvalues")

```
Here we can see that the first Principal Component (PC) accounts for 22% of the overall variability (11% for PC2).

# 3. Plot of individuals

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Add 'year' variable to plot results 
PCA_indiv<-PCA%>%
  broom::augment(PCA_data)

# Plot of individuals
ggplot(
  data=PCA_indiv,
  aes(.fittedPC1, .fittedPC2,color=year))+
  geom_point()+
  labs(
    title = 'Plot of individuals',
    subtitle = 'Color shows year of song creation',
    x='PC1 (22%)',
    y='PC2 (11%)',
    color='Year'
  )+
  theme_minimal()

```

It seems that PC1 distinguishes well the songs according to their years of creation. We will now see which variables contribute the most to this axis.

# 4. Plot of variables

Variable coordinates are stored in the "rotation" matrix. We can extract these coordinates as follows:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

PCA_var<-PCA %>%
  # Extract variable coordinates
  tidy(matrix = "rotation") %>%
  # Format table form long to wide
  pivot_wider(names_from = "PC", names_prefix = "PC", values_from = "value")%>%
  # Rename column with variable names
  rename(Variable=column)%>%
  # 'Clean' variable names 
  # Upper case on first letter
  mutate(Variable=stringr::str_to_title(Variable))%>%
  # Change '_' for space
  mutate(Variable=stringr::str_replace_all(Variable,"_"," "))

head(PCA_var)

```

We may now plot the variables.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Load ggrepel to avoid variable names to overlap
library(ggrepel)

var<-ggplot(data=PCA_var,aes(PC1, PC2)) +
  # Add variables arrows
  geom_segment(
    xend = 0, yend = 0, 
    arrow = arrow(
      length = unit(0.03, "npc"),
      ends = "first"
    )
  )+
  # Add variables names
  geom_text_repel(
    aes(label = Variable),
    hjust = 1,size=3,
    min.segment.length = Inf,
    nudge_x=0.01,nudge_y=0.01
  ) +
  coord_fixed()+
  labs(
    title = 'Plot of variables',
    x='PC1 (22%)',
    y='PC2 (11%)',
    color='Year'
  )+
  theme_minimal()

var

```

Now we will add year (which was not used for the PCA) as an additional variable on the graph of variables. To do so we will calculate the coordinates of year on the different axes of the PCA.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

year_coord<-as.data.frame(
  # Calculate correlation of year with PCA axis
  cor(PCA_data$year,PCA$x)
  )%>%
  # Add name of the variable
  mutate(Variable="Year")

year_coord

```

We may now add this additional variable to the plot of variables.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

var+
  geom_segment(
    data=year_coord,
    color="red",
    xend = 0, yend = 0, 
    arrow = arrow(
      length = unit(0.03, "npc"),
      ends = "first"
    )
  )+
  geom_text_repel(
    data=as.data.frame(year_coord),
    aes(label = Variable),
    color="red",hjust = 1,size=3,
    min.segment.length = Inf,
    nudge_x=0.02,nudge_y=-0.02
  )+
  labs(
    subtitle="Year as additional variable"
  )

```

We can see that the "Energy" variable is the most strongly correlated with the "Year" variable: Billboard hits tend to become more and more energetic over the years.

# 5. Add name of individuals

Finally, you may also add labels to the plot of individuals, to identify some specific points. This is what has been done below to identify the most popular songs in the same dataset.
