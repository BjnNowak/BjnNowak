<p><strong>Goals:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Perform sensitivity/uncertainty analysis</li>
<li>Calculate Root Mean Square Error</li>
<li>Optimize the model</li>
</ul>
<p>In the first part, we created a model that estimates the maximum potential yield of corn based on weather data (temperature and solar radiation). Briefly, this estimation is done in three steps:<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Estimation of number of leaves (based on daily temperature)<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Estimation of the amount of photosynthetically active light intercepted by the plants<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Conversion of this amount of radiation into biomass (first plant then grain)</p>
<p>We will now investigate the influence of the different parameters on the modelâ€™s results.</p>
