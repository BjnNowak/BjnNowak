```{r setup, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# Set Working directory for Notebook
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir='/Users/bnowak/Documents/231220/WD/AnalyseSyst/')
```

**Goals:**   

  * Perform sensitivity/uncertainty analysis 
  * Calculate Root Mean Square Error 
  * Optimize the model

In the first part, we created a model that estimates the maximum potential yield of corn based on weather data (temperature and solar radiation). Briefly, this estimation is done in three steps:     
  **1.** Estimation of number of leaves (based on daily temperature)    
  **2.** Estimation of the amount of photosynthetically active light intercepted by the plants   
  **3.** Conversion of this amount of radiation into biomass (first plant then grain)    

We will now investigate the influence of the different parameters on the model's results.
